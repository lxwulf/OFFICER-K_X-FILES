I wasn't happy with my first website. There was something I felt that wasnt
right. So the new journey or more part two of the journey started. I burned
hours and hours to find something better and especially easier to maintain.
I tried alot of different *static site generators*. Here are a few:

* [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
* [Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/)
* [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/)
* [Vuepress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/)

You see, a few came together. Most horrible experience was *Jekyll*,
because I had that much of dependencies problems, i lost the overview. Also the
different versions of the themes made some problems. When i got it done with
installation, the theme didnt work because of the wrong *Jekyll* version.
Downgrading wasnt that easy somehow. At the end after two solstices i decided
to end that trip.

Sadly *Hugo* was a similiar story. *Hakyll* i didnt even install after i saw
that this belongs to the Haskell programming language. The last thing I tried
was *Vuepress*.

Besides that *Vuepress* it relays on *Node.js*, it was quite interesting how it
was intended and builded. My problem was there I needed to learn at level zero
and I didnt have that time to do this. But I think i give that a look for my
next *static site generator hopping*.

So and which one is left? Thats right, it is *Zola*. The documentation anda
tutorials on youtube & co. are very nice and easy. So I installed it, you didnt
believe it but it was just a binary from the official repo, in my case the
fedora repo.

```bash
dnf install zola
```

This was everything. After that you can start with

```bash
zola init nameofyourproject
```

and

```bash
zola serve
```

for a live view on the local machine. For more help you can download one of the
themes from the community which i also did. You can modified as you want and or
of course create your on that base or completly new.

So here it is. My new design for the website before i go to another
*static site generators* like *vuepress* I stay on zola, i really like it.
