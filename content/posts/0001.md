Here it is, my new website. It is of course not perfect but a beginning.
You need to start somewhere, right? After that, you can develop further.
I have a lot of new Ideas I want to implement but step by step. At the
moment it stays, it is.

When you look at the source code, you may find some horrible things -
yes, the site is generated with a `static site generator`, shortly
`ssg`. It was handy for me, needed only some minimal `html` and `css`
files, the rest in is in `markdown`.

Just a small summary of how it works.

## How does it work? ðŸª›

I have two main `html` files.

> \_header.html

and

> \_footer.html

In it, I have just the general code for a `header` and a `footer`,
obviously.

Ah, I forgot, of course you also need one `css` file. In my case, it
nothing complicated and maybe copied from here and there.

> style.css

Then we can already generate the website with the `ssg`. I decided to
use an easy [one](https://www.romanzolotarev.com/ssg.html) by Roman
Zolotarev. It is even slightly modified because it doesn't render
Markdown lists. So when you also wanna use this `ssg-script` then you
can add following code to it somewhere between the different functions.

```bash
render_article_list() {
    urls="$1"
    base_url="$2"
    items=""
    for i in $1; do also 
        if ! echo $i | grep -Eq "index|contact"; then
            url="$i"
            page_tile=$(head -n 1 "$4/${i%\.html}.mg" | cut -c 3-)
            item="<li><a href="\"${url}\"">${page_title}</a></li>"
            items=$items$item
        fi
    done
    sed -i '' -e "s|<article>|<ul class="articles">${items}</ul></article>|g" "$3/index.html"
}
```
