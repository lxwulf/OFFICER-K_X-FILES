# Long version about me

At the moment, I learn the programming language [**Python**](https://python.org)
and besides that, I also play around with [**Ansible**](https://ansible.com) a lot.
In the future, I would also like to try [**Terraform**](https://www.terraform.io/)
since the virtual machines do not build themselves, yet.

I really like to automate things, because with it, you learn
a lot about different operating systems and their possibilities
what you can automate, especially on the Linux operating system.

Also, with the automation technology, you have time to do
more fun stuff in your life, and you finish your daily IT-Work faster.
What do you want more?

## What am I doing here? ü§î

From time to time, I would also upload some [posts](../posts/_index.md) and write
down my solution to my encountered *X-Files*. I would upload some solutions
also to [Github](https://github.com/lxwulf).
