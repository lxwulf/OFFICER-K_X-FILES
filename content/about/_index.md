## Who am I? 🧑‍💻

---

<p class="profil"><img src="profil_op.svg"></img></p>

I'm Officer K and successfully finished my degree as "IT System Engineering" last summer – 2021.
Im very interested into open source software and Linux.
I try to use open source software for my solutions of my problems and
situations.

## The Strategy 💡

---

**TLDR Version:**

My interests and tinkering are the following:

* Automation with Ansible
* Virtualization with KVM/QEMU/Virt-Manager
* Linux in General
* Looking into and testing different open source projects

Feel free to show me new software, hardware stuff or let us together work on
a new project!

You'll find more stuff at [Github](https://github.com/lxwulf). I would try
to upload and maintain more of my stuff, sometimes I'm just a bit shy to
publishing it... - I'm working on it!

---

At the moment, I learn the programming language [**Python**](https://python.org)
and besides that, I also play around with [**Ansible**](https://ansible.com) a lot.
In the future, I would also like to try [**Terraform**](https://www.terraform.io/)
since the virtual machines do not build themselves, yet.

I really like to automate things, because with it, you learn
a lot about different operating systems and their possibilities
what you can automate, especially on the Linux operating system.

Also, with the automation technology, you have time to do
more fun stuff in your life, and you finish your daily IT-Work faster.
What do you want more?

## What am I doing here? 🤔

---

From time to time, I would also upload some [posts](../posts/_index.md) and write
down my solution to my encountered *X-Files*. I would upload some solutions
also to [Github](https://github.com/lxwulf).
